The "World Population Analysis" dashboard is a comprehensive visualization tool designed to analyze global population trends over several years. It utilizes data from 1970 to 2023, providing insights into population dynamics across continents and countries. The repository contains a PowerBI dashboard that offers interactive features for exploring population data based on various parameters such as continent, country, and time period.

One notable trend highlighted in the dashboard is the shift in the most populated country over the years. In the 1900s, China held the title of the most populous country for several decades. However, as we entered the 2000s (20s), India emerged as the new leader in terms of population size.
